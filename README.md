# MYSQL-Login
An andoid application project where the user would log in using MYSQL. 

I would like to clarify that the scope of this project does not include the MYSQL code implementation, as it is being provided by our esteemed professor. The primary focus of this project centers around refining the 'Task.java' file by incorporating all the necessary methods essential for the seamless and efficient execution of the application.
